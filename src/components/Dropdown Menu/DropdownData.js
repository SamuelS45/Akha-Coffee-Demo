        title: 'Is organic no-till farming possible?',
        text:'No-till farming (also known as zero tillage or direct drilling) is an agricultural technique for growing crops or pasture without disturbing the soil through tillage. No-till farming decreases the amount of soil erosion tillage causes in certain soils, especially in sandy and dry soils on sloping terrain.'

        title: "If you can't overwater plants in soil, why don't plants drown in hydroponics?",
        text:'Properly done hydroponic systems do not drown or overwater plants because the root system is never completely submerged in water. In addition, hydroponic systems often employ air pumps and air stones to oxygenate the water, providing oxygen to the submerged root system that otherwise will drown.'

    {
        title: 'Is farming profitable?',
        text:'Although farming was once primarily an activity to sustain the farmer and his family, farming can be a money-making enterprise. The two major avenues of income for a farm business are using the farm land and leasing the land to another farmer.'
